                    The 2026 Taipei Lantern Festival introduces its first-ever “Two Areas, Two IPs” concept, uniting powerhouse characters to light up the city. On the evening of February 25, Taipei Mayor Wan-an Chiang illuminated the 10-meter-tall Transformers main lantern, Optimus Prime, at the Taipei Expo Park Area. Featuring synchronized light choreography, dramatic smoke effects, more than 40 surrounding special-effect fixtures, and exclusive Transformers music, the installation makes a bold and spectacular debut. Beyond the IP-themed lanterns, the Taipei Expo Park Area also showcases the “Team Taipei Bravo Bear” 12-District lantern series, artist installations, and a Friendship Lantern Zone, inviting visitors to explore the displays and plan a full Taipei experience.

                    At the opening ceremony, Mayor Wan-an Chiang described the Taipei Lantern Festival as a signature annual event for visitors from Taiwan and abroad. This year, the city government takes an innovative leap with the “Two Areas, Two IPs” format, bringing together the globally renowned Transformers and POP MART to highlight Taipei’s diversity, inclusivity, and creative energy. The Taipei Expo Park Area features three standout highlights: the 10-meter-tall Transformers installation paired with exclusive music, a Friendship Lantern Zone presenting works from 13 countries and cities, including first-time participation by the American Institute in Taiwan, and a thoughtfully curated Artist Lantern Zone. As the festival coincides with flower season, visitors are encouraged to plan a short getaway, admire seasonal blooms, visit nearby temples, explore the Zhongshan shopping district and Qingguang Night Market for local flavors, and end the evening among the lantern displays. Mayor Chiang added with a smile that his children, Te-yu and Te-cheng, are already debating which area to visit, and he welcomes everyone to take advantage of the holiday to experience both Taipei Expo Park and Ximending.

                    The Taipei Expo Park Area draws on the park’s natural landscape to create an immersive exhibition environment. In addition to the Optimus Prime main lantern, the area presents themed installations featuring Autobot ally Bumblebee, Decepticon leader Megatron, and dramatic battle scenes between the Autobots and Decepticons. Integrated lighting design and environmental staging transport visitors into the world of Transformers.

                    Beyond the Transformers installations, the Department of Information and Tourism highlights a variety of must-see lanterns throughout the park. Debuting this year is the “Team Taipei Bravo Bear” 12-District lantern series. Taipei’s beloved mascot Bravo Bear appears in district-inspired costumes, representing each administrative district and forming a spirited city team as charming ambassadors of their communities.

                    The Department further notes that the Friendship Lantern Zone brings together distinctive works from 13 countries and cities. In celebration of the 250th anniversary of the United States, the American Institute in Taiwan is participating for the first time, symbolizing the strong friendship between Taiwan and the United States.

                    This year’s Artist Lantern Zone also showcases imaginative creations. “Whimsy Fizzy Rhapsody” introduces a collection of delightful creatures, including Doodoo Beast, Tootoo Horse, Roarro Dragon, and Zhen Qi Guai, each with its own story. When visitors touch the installation, the lighting shifts and bubbles or mist effects appear, creating an engaging sensory interaction. “Gymnastics Baron” features a futuristic astronaut descending into Taipei Expo Park and gazing at the stars, symbolizing a great traveler completing an interstellar journey. “BASE” draws inspiration from Taipei’s city nightscape, while “SPACE TAIPEI” represents the city’s upward drive. “Blooming Galaxy” blends flowers, light, and extraterrestrial elements into a lifeform-like installation that appears to descend from the cosmos, creating a fantastical scene that transcends reality.
