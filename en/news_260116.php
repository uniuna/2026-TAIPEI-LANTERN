                    On January 16, during the first press conference for the “2026 Taipei Lantern Festival”, the Department of Information and Tourism, Taipei City Government, officially announced a brand new curatorial model, “two zones, two IPs”. Spanning both the Ximen Lantern Area and the Expo Park Lantern Area, the festival will take place from February 25 to March 15. According to Director Hsiang Yu, the most anticipated highlight this year is the major IP collaboration at the Expo Park site, where the festival joins forces with the world famous franchise Transformers. Together, they will present never before seen themed lantern installations and immersive light performances. At the press conference, a 10 meter tall Optimus Prime lantern was unveiled in advance, and it is surely set to inject Taipei’s night skyline with striking sci-fi energy.

                    Director Yu explained that the 2026 festival features dual exhibition zones, with the Expo Park Lantern Area centered around the Transformers theme and complemented by works from a wide range of artists. This marks the first officially licensed Transformers lantern installation at a large scale themed lantern festival in Taiwan, making it a landmark collaboration. The display brings together three iconic characters, with Autobot leader Optimus Prime, his trusted ally Bumblebee, and his greatest rival Megatron, all appearing together at Expo Park. Optimus Prime takes the spotlight as a large-scale three dimensional lantern installation, enhanced by rhythmic lighting and a site specific design to create an immersive viewing experience filled with motion and power. It is expected to become one of the most talked about highlights of this year’s festival.
