                    The "2026 Taipei Lantern Festival" is reaching new heights of excitement! From February 25 to March 15 at the Taipei Lantern Festival Expo Park Area, the event will debut a collaboration with the world-renowned IP "Transformers," launching the high-tech and buzz-worthy limited-edition "Optimus Prime" mini lantern. The design reflects the mechanical style and urban futurism of Transformers, featuring a striking and vibrant appearance that combines collectible value with interactive fun. The lanterns will be available for limited public pickup from March 1 to March 3 at the Expo Park and Ximen exhibition Areas, and will also be distributed at designated locations across Taipei’s 12 administrative districts from March 1 to March 2. We invite citizens of all ages to join the festivities, carry their lanterns, take photos, and create unforgettable memories during these joyful festival nights.

                    The Department of Information and Tourism (TPEDOIT) stated that the mini lanterns will be distributed over three days from March 1 to March 3 at the Expo Park and Ximen exhibition Areas. At the Expo Park Area, distribution will take place at the Information Counter (located at the Expo Park entrance flower wall); at the Ximen Area, it will be at Information Counter No. 2 (located at Zhongshan Hall Plaza). Distribution begins daily at 3:00 PM, with a limit of one lantern per person while supplies last. Additionally, for two days from March 1 to March 2, the 12 administrative districts of Taipei will offer free lantern pickup starting at 2:00 PM, limited to one per person while supplies last. The designated distribution sites for the 12 districts include: Daan District (Daan Forest Park Exit 8), Neihu District (Neihu Civic Center), Shilin District (Shilin District Administrative Center), Wenshan District (Plaza in front of Wenshan District Administrative Center), Beitou District (Beitou Cihou Temple), Zhongshan District (Zhongshan District Administrative Center), Xinyi District (South Entrance of Xinyi District Administrative Center), Songshan District (Songshan District Administrative Center), Wanhua District (Bopiliao Historical Block), Zhongzheng District (Next to Daxiao Gate of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, facing Aiguo East Road), Datong District (Datong District Administrative Center), and Nangang District (Nangang Station CityLink Plaza).

                    TPEDOIT further noted that the mini lanterns utilize removable button cell batteries for their LED lights. If not used for the lantern, these batteries can be repurposed for other small household electronic devices such as ear thermometers or remote controls. The department also reminds the public that exhausted batteries can be recycled at resource recovery trucks, community and school recycling points, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, chain pharmacies, and convenience stores (for more recycling information, please visit <a href="https://dep-recycle.gov.taipei/page/faq/index.aspx?page=2" target="_blank">the Department of Environmental Protection website</a>). During the festival, recycling bins for waste batteries will also be available at information counters and near large trash bins throughout the exhibition Areas, encouraging citizens to practice battery recycling and protect the environment.
