                    Mayor Wan-an Chiang attended the promotional press conference for the 2026 Taipei Lantern Festival on the 29th, officially announcing that this year’s festival will debut the innovative “Two Zones, Two IPs” format, aiming to attract visitors from Taiwan and abroad. The Ximending exhibition zone will collaborate with international designer toy brand POP MART, a partnership expected to generate unprecedented visitor numbers and set new tourism records.

                    Mayor Chiang shared that the Taipei Lantern Festival has been held for over 20 years and has become a highly anticipated annual event for both local residents and international travelers. Since taking office, he has continuously considered how to break away from tradition and draw a broader global audience. This year, the city introduces two major exhibition zones, Taipei Expo Park and Ximending, along with the unique dual IP model, showcasing Taipei’s inclusivity and creative vitality through diverse themes.

                    He further explained that connecting the two exhibition zones significantly expands the festival’s scale and is expected to stimulate economic activity in surrounding commercial areas, boosting both foot traffic and tourism. He expressed confidence that this year’s attendance will surpass previous records. The Ximen Lantern Area’s collaboration with POP MART, featuring six highly popular characters including Baby Molly, DIMOO, SKULLPANDA, TWINKLE TWINKLE, Hirono, and LABUBU, is expected to generate tremendous appeal. Mayor Chiang added humorously that he even asked his eldest child, Te-li, for character introductions the night before, and anticipates his younger children will soon insist on visiting the exhibition areas after the festival opens.

                    Mayor Chiang emphasized that Ximending is not only one of Taipei’s most iconic and popular destinations, but also represents the city’s youthful energy, rich food culture, and unique local shops. He warmly invites everyone to enjoy lantern viewing, savor local cuisine, and experience Taipei’s culture in depth.

                    He concluded by wishing the 2026 Taipei Lantern Festival great success and extended New Year blessings to all, wishing everyone smooth endeavors, happiness, and success in the Year of the Horse.
