                    To welcome the Lunar New Year, the highly anticipated “2026 Taipei Lantern Festival” returns from February 25 to March 15, to once again captivate visitors from Taiwan and around the world. This year marks the festival’s first ever “Two Zones, Two IPs” concept, created in collaboration with Transformers and two additional international IPs yet to be revealed. Themed lantern installations will illuminate both Ximending, Taipei’s trendsetting cultural hub, and Yuanshan’s Taipei Expo Park, where culture meets lush greenery. Through dazzling lantern artistry woven into the urban landscape, the festival promises a fresh and unforgettable viewing experience for residents and travelers alike.

                    To complement the festival, the Department of Information and Tourism, Taipei City Government, has curated 20 themed travel itineraries, offering visitors creative ways to catch all the lanterns while checking out the city. Travelers can easily reach Taipei via the Taiwan High Speed Rail or Taiwan Railway, then transfer to the MRT to begin their journey. During the day, explore cultural landmarks such as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Nanmen Market, and the Taipei Botanical Garden, or head to Dadaocheng and Dihua Street to soak up traditional Lunar New Year vibes. Nature lovers can plan a relaxing escape to Yangmingshan or Qingtiangang, where sweeping landscapes blend beautifully with city views. As night falls, simply take the MRT to the Ximen or Expo Park lantern zones to enjoy the glowing displays, rounding out a well balanced Taipei getaway that blends activity with relaxation.

                    For travelers seeking a deeper experience, suggested two or three day itineraries invite visitors to explore attractions around both lantern zones, including Lungshan Temple, the City God Temple of Taipei City, the Zhongshan shopping district, and the Qingguang shopping area. Trips can also be extended to Neihu to visit the Baishihu Suspension Bridge, or to Chiang Kai-shek Shilin Residence for the Tulip Exhibition (February 26 to March 8), as well as the Taipei Rose Garden (Xinsheng Park) for the Rose Exhibition (March 6 to April 6). These routes bring together culture, nature, and seasonal blooms in a single journey. In addition, the Department has partnered with 64 local hotels, including Courtyard by Marriott Taipei, The Grand Hotel Taipei, and Regent Taipei, to offer exclusive perks such as accommodation discounts and late check out. Special transportation and hotel packages are also available through “T Holiday,” making travel to Taipei easy and convenient for visitors from central and southern Taiwan.
